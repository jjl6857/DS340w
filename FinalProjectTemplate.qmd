## Introduction

This project aims to forecast future crime rates in Los Angeles by analyzing crime data from 2023 to the present. The goal is to explore how factors such as socio-economic changes, mobility patterns, and land-use influence crime dynamics and to use machine learning models to predict future trends. The study will help identify areas of concern, allowing law enforcement to allocate resources more effectively.

### Motivations:

-   **Post-Pandemic Crime Evolution:** The COVID-19 pandemic changed crime trends in cities. Lockdowns, reduced mobility, and economic stress led to fewer property crimes but an increase in domestic violence and cybercrime. This shift provides a chance to study how crises affect criminal behavior and how law enforcement can prepare for future changes.

    **Localized Crime Hotspots:** In a large city like Los Angeles, crime isn’t spread evenly. Factors like population density, land use, and socio-economic conditions create crime hotspots. Knowing these patterns is key for law enforcement to use resources wisely and stop crimes before they grow. This study aims to offer targeted insights to improve urban safety.

    **Mobility and Criminal Opportunities:** Los Angeles, with its high mobility and frequent visitors, sees crime rates shift based on movement patterns. Areas with heavy foot traffic often have more crime opportunities, partly due to visitor anonymity. This project explores the link between urban mobility and crime to better understand how movement shapes criminal chances.

### Goal of the Project:

\
The main goal of this project is to predict crime rates in Los Angeles based on data from 2023-2024 and to forecast crime trends for the year 2025. By analyzing historical data, this study aims to provide insights that help law enforcement agencies prepare for and address emerging crime patterns. Several key questions will guide this research:

**Impact of Post-Pandemic Socio-Economic Changes**: How have the socio-economic factors in 2023-2024, such as unemployment rates, population density, and mobility patterns, influenced different types of crime in Los Angeles? Are there observable shifts in criminal behavior that need targeted intervention?

**Spatial and Temporal Crime Dynamics**: Which neighborhoods and times of day are most prone to criminal activities? How do urban characteristics, such as mixed land use and foot traffic, affect crime rates in these areas? Understanding these dynamics will allow for better allocation of law enforcement resources.

**Predictive Modeling**: Can machine learning models accurately forecast crime trends for 2025 based on historical and real-time data? Which methods and models provide the best accuracy for predicting crime rates and identifying emerging hotspots?

### Omissions and Context

This project aims to fill these gaps by integrating diverse and dynamic data sources, like real-time mobility patterns and socio-economic indicators, to improve the accuracy of crime predictions. By advancing traditional methods and adopting machine learning techniques, the project recognizes the need for continuous model updates and the inclusion of new data to better predict crime trends in an ever-evolving urban landscape.
